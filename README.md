Duck face mask for the D-FI, October edition

This uses [this duck from thingiverse][duck-stl].

Just type 'make' to create the stl file (assumes openscad to be installed).
Creates a 'duck-mask.stl' and a 'duck-mask.png' view of the current version of
the mask

other branches contain other work to make a variety of masks, using the base
scad file as a template
